### What is Wardley Mapping?

Wardley Mapping is a novel approach for understanding the landscape of business activities and the evolution of ideas, technologies, and practices over time. Originally conceived by Simon Wardley in 2005, it provides a visual framework for strategic situational awareness and planning. 

At its core, Wardley Mapping examines the value chain of activities that an organization performs to deliver products and services. It provides a systematic way to illustrate the dependencies and flow between activities, helping teams understand not just what they need to do, but why.

A key aspect of Wardley Maps is the inclusion of *context* - the concept of climate. This captures the changing nature of the landscape, characterized by the forces that constrain and impact activities like security, regulation, or infrastructure. By mapping climate patterns like pioneer-settler-town planner transitions, teams gain insight into epoch shifts.

This understanding of situational context helps leaders spot upcoming inflection points and make better strategic decisions. It provides actionable insight into whether activities should be outsourced, optimized, or commoditized given their climate suitability and evolution. Teams can also identify useful anchor points to orient value chain transformation.

In essence, Wardley Mapping delivers a novel visualization method for strategic planning and decision making. It shines light on the connections between activities, their evolution, and external influences. Leadership teams can leverage these maps to manage transitions, identify opportunities, and transform organizations for the future effectively.

The practical value of mapping for business has expanded usage from government bodies like the UK Cabinet Office to global firms like AWS. Wardley Mapping provides an adaptable framework for diverse scenarios, underpinning more resilient operations. With growing adoption across industries, its popularity stems from the ability to reveal new strategic perspectives through novel abstraction techniques.
