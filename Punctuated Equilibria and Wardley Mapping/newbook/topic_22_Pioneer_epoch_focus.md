### Pioneer epoch focus

The pioneer epoch represents the birth of a new value chain component, where innovation and experimentation define the landscape. Mapping during this epoch should focus on the chaotic, rapidly evolving nature of the pioneer space.  

In the pioneer epoch, the key goals are to identify and support novel ideas that could become the next defining standard. Since the climate is characterized by high levels of uncertainty, mapping should capture the unpredictable patterns of genesis and disruption. Track pioneer movement and diffusion through the value chain to spot innovations gaining traction.

**Discovery Over Optimization**

In the pioneer stage, optimization is less important than discovery through trial-and-error. Map a broad range of pioneer components rather than a detailed analysis of established products. Value lies more in the ongoing experiments than the temporary victors, so track pioneer diversity as well as diffusion velocity.

**Uncover the Genome**

The pioneer epoch maps the genesis of foundational technologies that will influence subsequent settler and town planner developments. Map for learnability - look for the core principles and key characteristics behind pioneering innovations to guide future settlers.

**Assess Climate Impact**

The climate plays an outsized role during the pioneer epoch, with external factors rapidly altering the visibility and viability of ideas. Track how the changing climate exposes or eliminates pioneer species, using mapping to uncover the climate patterns that filter innovations.

In summary, mapping during the pioneer epoch should capture broad experimentation, sudden disruptions, and the role of the external climate in filtering concepts. The insights uncovered will guide settlers in establishing useful standards for the next epoch. By tracking pioneer diversity, diffusion, and climate impact, mappers can reveal the genesis of new value chains.
