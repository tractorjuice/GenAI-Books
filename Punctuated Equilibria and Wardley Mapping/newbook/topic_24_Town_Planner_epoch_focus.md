### Town Planner epoch focus

The Town Planner epoch emerges as an industrial component becomes widespread and well-understood. Mapping strategies should focus on optimization, coordination, and regulation during this epoch.

In the Town Planner epoch, a capability has reached saturation and provides little opportunity for differentiation. Competition shifts to more efficient delivery, often through economies of scale. Incumbents aim to tightly integrate the industrialized component into their value chains to maximize efficiency.

As mapping strategists, our recommendations should reflect this epoch's characteristics:

**Drive standardization and consolidation.** The priority is improving reliability and efficiency through standardized interfaces and consolidation of providers. Maps should identify duplication across large vendors and guide consolidation roadmaps.

**Coordinate governance regimes.** With multiple vendors dependent on the same commoditized components, coordinating governance and regulation is crucial. Mapping should aid policymakers in regulating the component to balance stability, security, resilience, and innovation.

**Pursue incremental optimizations.** In the Town Planner epoch, most advances come through modest, sustaining innovations that marginally improve cost, quality, or convenience. Mapping should identify incremental improvement opportunities across affected value chains.

**Plan for disruption.** No epoch lasts forever. Maps should watch for novel innovations that may one day disrupt the industrialized component and trigger a pioneer epoch. Early detection allows organizations to shape disruption to their advantage.

As this overview illustrates, Wardley Mapping provides invaluable insight to help leaders navigate the unique dynamics of the Town Planner epoch. The mapping focus shifts from differentiation to standardization, coordination, regulation, and optimization. By targeting these areas, mapping informs strategies that maximize efficiency and stability during this critical epoch phase.
