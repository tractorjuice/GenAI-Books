## Value Chain

The value chain is a key component of a Wardley map. It represents the flow of activities and components that an organization uses to deliver value to customers. 

In the context of mapping, the value chain provides an outline of the capabilities and services an organization must master. By positioning these on the map relative to market forces, organizations gain insight into the maturity and evolvability of their offerings.

### Defining the Value Chain

The first step is identifying the key activities that comprise the organization's value chain. This includes:

- **Inbound logistics** - obtaining raw materials and components
- **Operations** - transforming inputs into products/services  
- **Outbound logistics** - distributing finished offerings
- **Marketing and sales** - customer acquisition 
- **Infrastructure** - technology, systems and processes enabling delivery

Additional activities may be included as necessary to fully represent the delivery of the organization's value proposition.

When defining the value chain, it is also important to consider the scope - is the map representing an entire enterprise, a business unit, or an individual product? The value chain should match the appropriate scope.

### Positioning on the Map

Once defined, the value chain activities are positioned onto the Wardley map according to their maturity level within the market. 

For example, well-established capabilities like operations infrastructure would typically be placed rather far to the right side of the map, indicating they are widespread commodities. Meanwhile, emerging capabilities like predictive analytics may be placed further left, showing they are novel innovations.

The vertical positioning depends on how core that capability is to delivering the primary value proposition versus peripheral enhancements. This placement provides insight into the co-evolution between an organization's offerings and the market.

### Evolving the Value Chain

As epochs shift and the climate changes, the value chain represented on the map must evolve as well. By tracking movements and changes, organizations can identify capabilities that are becoming core and thus require greater focus and investment.

Meanwhile, capabilities that have highly commoditized can potentially be eliminated or outsourced. The visibility provided by value chain mapping informs strategic decisions around business model transformation and resource allocation.

### Summary

In summary, the value chain is a visualization of the key activities that enable an organization to deliver value. By positioning these capabilities relative to market maturity and disruption over time, Wardley mapping offers unique insights to guide evolution and maintain strategic relevance. The dynamic value chain map becomes a tool for navigating epochs.
