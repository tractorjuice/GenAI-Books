## Visualization Tips

Creating useful and effective Wardley maps requires understanding some key visualization principles. The map visual design greatly impacts how well the information is communicated and interpreted. Follow these tips when constructing your maps:  

### Use appropriate symbols

- Carefully select map symbols and icons that accurately represent components
- Leverage standard iconography where possible for common elements like users, infrastructure, code 
- Maintain consistency in icon usage across maps to enable comparison

### Emphasize importance 
	
- Vary icon size to indicate value or importance of components
- Use color intensity, borders, etc. to highlight critical parts of the value chain
	
### Show evolution clearly
	
- Position components appropriately from left (Genesis) to right (Commoditized) 
- Add labels indicating the main evolution stages like Pioneer, Settler, Town Planner
- Use color gradation to indicate progression across stages
	
### Surface relationships
		
- Place interconnected components in proximity and connect with arrows/lines
- Call out key dependencies, flows, and interactions in map legend

### Enhance readability

- Use minimal text, focusing on essential component names and stage labels
- Include a descriptive title and concise caption for context
- Allow whitespace between elements; avoid overcrowding

### Iterate carefully
	
- Create draft maps early and refine frequently for maximum utility
- Review with stakeholders and users to ensure accurate representation
- Update periodically as strategy and focus shifts
		
In summary, effective Wardley map visualization requires thoughtful design choices that emphasize priorities, evolution states, relationships, and clarity. Careful iteration and stakeholder input helps produce maps that communicate key information for strategy and decision making during epoch shifts. Following these tips will enable impactful visualization aligned to the mapping principles.
