### Anchor Points

Anchor points are key components within a value chain that have remained largely unchanged over time. They represent stable foundations upon which higher order value can be built. Identifying anchor points is crucial when mapping out a landscape to understand what parts are more dynamic or rapidly evolving.

There are several characteristics that signify potential anchor points:

**Entrenchment.** Anchor points become deeply embedded within systems, processes, infrastructure, and even culture. Attempting to displace or replace them requires tremendous effort and cost. Mainframe computing systems that underpin critical legacy business applications are a prime example - despite newer technologies, unraveling decades of systems integration renders mainframes firmly entrenched.

**Interoperability.** Components that seamlessly interoperate with many other parts of the value system create reliance and inertia. The TCP/IP protocol, for instance, is interwoven through networking infrastructure, cloud platforms, internet services, endpoints, and more. Shifting protocols requires coordinated upgrades across all interoperating components.

**Regulation.** Compliance with regulatory, legal or contractual requirements solidifies a component's standing. Examples include payment card industry standards in finance and various data protection protocols in healthcare. Bringing new systems up to compliance specifications is an arduous process.

**Market Power.** When a component holds strong market dominance, it shapes de facto standards and expectations. The position of Intel's x86 architecture provides a platform stability that discourages shifts to alternative chipsets. Similarly, active vendor ecosystems and broad adoption lead to runaway network effects that act as gravity wells.

The mapping process should methodically review the value landscape, flagging components that bear these anchoring characteristics. They manifest the inertia that resists change, so must be accounted for in transition planning and management.

In epochs of stability, anchor points provide robust foundations to support incremental innovation on higher order activities. But in epochs of rapid change, they risk becoming boat anchors that drag down agility and responsiveness. This is why transitional leadership must learn to leverage anchor points appropriately - relying on their strengths, while circumventing their inertia. Wardley mapping illuminates this critical distinction for navigating shifts between epochs.
