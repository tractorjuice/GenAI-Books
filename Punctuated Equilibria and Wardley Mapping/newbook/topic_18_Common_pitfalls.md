## Common pitfalls

Creating effective Wardley Maps can be challenging. It's important to understand common issues that can reduce a map's accuracy and usefulness. By learning to avoid these pitfalls, practitioners can improve their mapping skills.  

The first major pitfall is failing to validate the value chain with real users. Maps aim to reflect genuine user needs rather than assumed requirements. Without user research, maps may focus on activities that users don't actually value. Conducting interviews and observation is essential to constructing an insightful value chain.  

Another common trap is getting lost in unnecessary detail. Maps should provide a high-level, strategic view. Trying to capture minor implementation activities dilutes the value of mapping. Resist over-engineering a map with low-value details unlikely to impact decision making. Focus on the 20% of factors causing 80% of outcomes.  

Practitioners also often struggle to identify appropriate anchor points for positioning. Useful anchors reflect well-understood capabilities widely available in the industry. Choosing niche or leading-edge capabilities as anchors overestimates maturity. Select anchor points representing the mainstream majority to enable accurate positioning.  

Failing to validate a map's structure with subject matter experts is also problematic. Experts familiar with the market can highlight missing or inaccurate elements and connections. Their feedback improves contextual accuracy and prevents assumptions being baked into the final map. 

In summary, create maps based on user insights, focus on strategic priorities, leverage mainstream anchors, and solicit expert validation. Avoiding these pitfalls leads to more meaningful maps that provide greater strategic clarity. With practice and care, practitioners can learn to create maps that uncover valuable insights.
