## Steps

Creating useful and insightful Wardley Maps requires careful attention to a systematic process. By methodically following key steps, mappers can produce high-quality maps that provide clarity into a business, product, or market landscape.  

The first step is to **identify the purpose and scope** for the mapping exercise. Determining the specific questions trying to be answered and the breadth of the landscape to analyze provides focus and direction. For example, the purpose may be to understand the evolution stages of various components in an enterprise IT ecosystem in order to guide technology investment priorities for the next 3 years.  

Once the purpose is established, the next critical step is to **map the value chain**. This involves breaking down the target landscape into its fundamental value chain building blocks, such as user needs, interface/distribution channels, service provision, logistics/infrastructure, and more. The goal is to capture all the key elements that contribute to the creation, delivery and capture of value.

After constructing the value chain, the third step is to **position components appropriately**. This refers to placing each building block along the map's evolution axis, indicating whether a component is novel/new, evolving, or commoditized/utility. The mapper must analyze the climate, anchor points, and other signals to determine the most accurate evolution positioning for each element. 

The fourth step focuses on **identifying and denoting climate patterns**. As discussed in earlier sections, Wardley Maps indicate standard climate cycles such as peace, war, and wonder with consistent symbology. Detecting these climatic phases provides crucial insight. For example, a hot wartime climate may necessitate a conscious orchestration approach.

Once climate layers are shown, the fifth step is to **visualize and annotate dependencies**. This impactful stage involves drawing connection lines between landscape components to denote dependencies. Annotating these relationship lines with notes clarifies the linkages. Such dependency analysis uncovers how evolution movements in one area of the map may influence other domains.

The final step is to **iterate and update the map over time**. The mapping process does not end with the initial version. Regular updates that reflect learnings, new influences, and movements keep the maps relevant. Comparing updated versions highlights valuable evolution patterns.

In summary, Wardley Mapping requires clear scope, accurate value chain breakdowns, precise evolution positioning, climate detection, dependency links, and consistent iteration. By consciously executing these key steps, organizations can unlock profound insights through mapping.
