### Climate

The concept of climate is central to understanding value chain evolution in Wardley Mapping. Climate refers to the prevailing economic conditions, infrastructure maturity, and cultural attitudes surrounding a particular component or activity.

The climate exerts a powerful influence on the evolution of a value chain over time. Mild climates enable rapid movement, while harsh climates hamper component progress. As the climate changes for a component, whether due to internal or external shifts, the evolution patterns and pace will adapt accordingly.

There are three primary types of climate:

**Pioneer**

A pioneer climate is characterized by high levels of uncertainty. Components in this climate have poorly defined value chains and face shifting customer needs or scarce infrastructure resources. Organizations require tolerance for failure and a capacity for improvisation to operate effectively here.

**Settler**

A settler climate indicates growing stability and expanding infrastructure support. Clear value chains emerge as customer needs become well-understood. Financial efficiency and low margins are prioritized within settled climates.

**Town Planner**

A town planner climate reflects high levels of predictability and dependency for other value chain components. Operationally efficient, financially optimized execution is expected. Regulation, extensive infrastructure, and detailed planning are common here.

The climate context shapes appropriate tactics. For example, in a pioneer climate, placing small, risky bets to probe possible approaches is advised. In a town planner climate, leveraging well-defined standards and interfaces is recommended.

As Wardley Mapping tracks value chain evolution over time, the climate provides insight into progress constraints or acceleration opportunities. A climate mismatch, where components operate as if conditions were different than reality, often indicates impending disruption.

Understanding climate patterns provides organizations with anticipation of upcoming shifts that may necessitate strategy changes. It also helps leaders adjust the operating models, governance, and capabilities to fit the present climate context across value streams. In this way, climate serves as a guiding force for mapping evolution and determining suitable responses.
