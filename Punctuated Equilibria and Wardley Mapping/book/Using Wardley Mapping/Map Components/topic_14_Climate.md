### Climate

Climate is a crucial component of Wardley maps that represents the market context surrounding a value chain. Specifically, climate refers to the attitudes, infrastructure, and governance that enable - or constrain - the evolution of components within a value chain. Understanding climate is key to interpreting what a map conveys.

The climate operates at the macro level, shaping the environment in which value chains develop. Certain climates foster innovation and enable rapid evolution from genesis to commodity (e.g. a start-up ecosystem climate). Other climates resist change and inhibit advancement (e.g. a heavily regulated climate). Climate can also shift dramatically, usually due to an external disruption or trend shift. Epoch shifts often coincide with climate shifts.

Within a map, climate is depicted through color coding and annotations. Hotter colors like red represent supportive, pioneering climates. Cooler colors like blue indicate resistant, settled climates. Annotating the prevailing climate and movements using terms like "pioneering", "settling", and "industrializing" helps viewers quickly grasp context. 

Climate should be considered throughout mapping:

**Anchor Point Placement**

Anchor points reflect assumptions about climate. Placing them requires understanding which climates allow component evolution. 

**Movement Interpretation**

The pace and direction of movement depends on climate. Rapid advancement from genesis to commodity may indicate a supportive pioneer climate.

**Transition Management**

To shift climate, adjustments must be made to attitudes, infrastructure, and governance through change initiatives.

In summary, climate shapes the evolution trajectory of value chains. Mapping climate provides situational awareness to help leaders determine appropriate strategies for the pioneer, settler, and town planner epochs. The climate overlay to value chains is a unique aspect of Wardley mapping.
