### Managing movement

Movement in Wardley Mapping refers to the act of evolving components from the pioneer stage to the settler stage to the town planner stage. Managing this movement well is key to successful transitions between epochs. 

In the pioneer epoch, the focus should be on enabling rapid movement of newly created components to the settler stage. Provide pioneers the autonomy to experiment, while setting clear objectives aligned to the overarching company vision. Encourage sharing of innovative ideas across teams and promote a culture of learning.  

As components show product-market fit and begin moving to the settler stage, institute just enough process and coordination to enable scaling, without stifling innovation. Provide centralized support functions and platforms that can be leveraged across business units. Identify any bottlenecks or constraints that could limit growth.  

Finally, as competition increases, focus shifts to optimizing and enhancing components now in the town planner stage. Standardize interfaces between stable components to maximize efficiency and interoperability. Watch for new substitute technologies from pioneers and determine if internal components need reinvigorating or replacing to retain competitive advantage.   

Carefully tracking these movements between stages can also help identify upcoming epoch shifts. A surge of pioneer stage components signals the start of a new S-curve, while proliferation of industrialized town planner components indicates the current S-curve is peaking. Adjust innovation investments, organizational structures, and strategies ahead of impending epoch transitions.

By deliberately managing the flow of Wardley map components across stages, transitions between epochs can be anticipated and capitalized on, rather than reacted to. Leadership should plan for these technology and business cycles, evolving their focus from disruptive innovation to optimization and back again. This integrates the epoch concept from punctuated equilibrium theory into Wardleyâ€™s view of component evolution.
