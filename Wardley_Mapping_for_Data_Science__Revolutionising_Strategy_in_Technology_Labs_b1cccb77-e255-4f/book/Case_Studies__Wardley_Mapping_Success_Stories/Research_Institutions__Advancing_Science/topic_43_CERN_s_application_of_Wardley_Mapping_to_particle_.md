The European Organisation for Nuclear Research, commonly known as CERN, stands at the forefront of particle physics research, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the universe. In recent years, CERN has embraced Wardley Mapping as a strategic tool to enhance its research capabilities, optimise resource allocation, and drive innovation in the complex field of particle physics. This case study examines how CERN has successfully implemented Wardley Mapping within its data science and technology laboratory environment, offering valuable insights for other research institutions and government bodies seeking to leverage this powerful strategic planning methodology.

CERN's adoption of Wardley Mapping began as a response to the increasing complexity of particle physics experiments and the exponential growth of data generated by its Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The organisation recognised the need for a more sophisticated approach to strategic planning that could account for the rapid evolution of technologies, the interdependencies between various research components, and the long-term nature of particle physics projects.

Mapping the Particle Physics Value Chain: CERN's initial application of Wardley Mapping focused on visualising the entire value chain of particle physics research. This comprehensive mapping exercise revealed the complex interplay between various components, from fundamental theoretical work to experimental design, data collection, analysis, and the ultimate goal of scientific discovery. By mapping these elements along the evolution axis, CERN gained valuable insights into which areas were ripe for innovation and which had become commoditised.

One of the key revelations from this mapping exercise was the identification of data processing and analysis as a critical bottleneck in the research pipeline. While detector technologies and data collection capabilities had advanced rapidly, the ability to process and analyse the vast amounts of data generated by experiments had not kept pace. This insight led CERN to prioritise investments in advanced computing infrastructure and machine learning algorithms to enhance data processing capabilities.

Optimising Data Processing and Analysis Workflows: Armed with the insights from their Wardley Maps, CERN embarked on an ambitious project to optimise its data processing and analysis workflows. By visualising the evolution of various data science components, from raw data collection to final analysis, CERN was able to identify opportunities for automation, parallelisation, and the application of cutting-edge machine learning techniques.

This has been instrumental in our efforts to handle the enormous data volumes generated by the LHC. - Dr Elena Simioni, CERN Data Science Lead

One of the most significant outcomes of this optimisation effort was the development of the REANA platform, a reusable and reproducible research data analysis platform. REANA was designed to address the challenges identified through Wardley Mapping, such as the need for scalable computing resources, reproducibility of analyses, and collaboration among researchers. The platform has since become an essential tool for CERN scientists and has been adopted by other research institutions worldwide.

Enhancing Collaboration and Resource Allocation: Wardley Mapping also played a crucial role in enhancing collaboration and optimising resource allocation across CERN's various experiments and research groups. By creating maps that visualised the dependencies between different teams and projects, CERN was able to identify opportunities for shared resources, knowledge transfer, and strategic partnerships.

This approach led to the establishment of the CERN OpenLab, a unique public-private partnership that brings together CERN researchers with leading technology companies. The OpenLab's focus areas, including advanced computing, machine learning, and quantum technologies, were directly informed by the strategic insights gained through Wardley Mapping.

Driving Innovation in Detector Technologies: Another area where Wardley Mapping has had a significant impact is in driving innovation in detector technologies. By mapping the evolution of various detector components and their associated manufacturing processes, CERN was able to identify areas where custom development was still necessary and where off-the-shelf solutions could be leveraged.

This strategic approach led to the development of new silicon pixel detectors with unprecedented resolution and radiation hardness, crucial for the high-luminosity upgrades of the LHC. The mapping process also highlighted the potential for technology transfer, resulting in the application of CERN's detector technologies in fields such as medical imaging and airport security.

Long-term Strategic Planning for Future Colliders: Perhaps the most far-reaching application of Wardley Mapping at CERN has been in the strategic planning for future particle colliders. As the organisation contemplates the next generation of experiments beyond the LHC, Wardley Mapping has provided a valuable framework for assessing the technological readiness, potential impact, and strategic importance of various proposed projects.

By creating maps that project the evolution of key technologies and research areas over the coming decades, CERN has been able to make more informed decisions about resource allocation and research priorities. This long-term strategic planning, informed by Wardley Mapping, has been crucial in securing funding and support for ambitious projects such as the proposed Future Circular Collider (FCC).

In conclusion, CERN's application of Wardley Mapping to particle physics research demonstrates the power of this strategic tool in driving innovation, optimising resources, and enhancing collaboration in complex scientific environments. The success of this approach at CERN offers valuable lessons for other research institutions and government bodies seeking to implement Wardley Mapping in their own data science and technology laboratories.
