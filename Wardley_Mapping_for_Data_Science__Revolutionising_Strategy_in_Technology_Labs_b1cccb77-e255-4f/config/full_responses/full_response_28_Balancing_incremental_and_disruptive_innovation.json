Wardley Mapping provides a powerful framework for identifying and visualising opportunities for both types of innovation, enabling organisations to make informed decisions about their innovation portfolio. This balance is essential for driving progress whilst managing risk and resource allocation effectively."

In contrast, disruptive innovation involves the introduction of novel solutions that significantly alter the market landscape. Both play vital roles in an organisation's growth and competitive positioning, but they require different approaches and resources."
