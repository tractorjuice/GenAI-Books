Wardley Mapping, when integrated with the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) methodology, offers a powerful approach to achieve this goal. This section explores how Wardley Maps can significantly improve the business understanding phase of CRISP-DM, providing data scientists and project managers with a more comprehensive and strategic view of their projects."
