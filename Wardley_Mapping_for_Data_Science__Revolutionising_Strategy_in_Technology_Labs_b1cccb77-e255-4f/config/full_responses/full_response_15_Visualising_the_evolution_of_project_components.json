This process allows organisations to gain a strategic advantage by understanding how different elements of their data science projects evolve over time, enabling more informed decision-making and resource allocation."

For example, when mapping for the UK's Government Digital Service, we found that some components considered 'Custom-built' in other sectors were already 'Commodity' within the government's extensive digital infrastructure."

This approach allowed the Ministry to anticipate skill gaps, infrastructure needs, and potential ethical challenges well in advance."
