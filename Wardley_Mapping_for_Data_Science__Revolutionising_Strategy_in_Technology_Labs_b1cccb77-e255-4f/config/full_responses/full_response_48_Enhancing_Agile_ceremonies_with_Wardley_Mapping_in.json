However, they often lack the strategic context that Wardley Mapping provides. By incorporating Wardley Mapping insights into Agile ceremonies, teams can gain a deeper understanding of their project's position within the broader technological and competitive landscape, leading to more informed decisions and better outcomes."

During sprint planning, the team can refer to their Wardley Map to identify which components of their project are in the 'custom-built' phase and which are moving towards 'product' or 'commodity'. This insight allows them to prioritise work on custom components that provide strategic advantage, while planning to adopt or integrate more standardised solutions for commoditised elements."

This approach allows stakeholders to better understand the strategic value of the work completed and how it contributes to the project's long-term goals."
