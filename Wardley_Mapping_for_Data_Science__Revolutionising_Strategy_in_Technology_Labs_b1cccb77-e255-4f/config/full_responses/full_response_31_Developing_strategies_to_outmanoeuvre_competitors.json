While many competitors were heavily invested in on-premises high-performance computing clusters, we anticipated the shift towards cloud-native data processing. By strategically investing in cloud expertise and tooling, the laboratory was able to achieve greater scalability and cost-efficiency, outmanoeuvring competitors who were encumbered by legacy infrastructure."

By mapping the entire genomic research value chain, we identified that data storage and basic sequence alignment tools were becoming commoditised. The consortium agreed to collaborate on developing open-source solutions for these components, allowing each institution to focus their competitive efforts on higher-value activities such as novel algorithm development and clinical application of genomic insights. This strategy allowed the consortium members to collectively outmanoeuvre commercial competitors by creating a more efficient and innovative ecosystem."
