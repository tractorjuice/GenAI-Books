By mapping various AI components\u2014from fundamental algorithms to advanced applications\u2014along the evolution axis, Google has gained a clearer understanding of which technologies are still in the genesis phase, which are custom-built, and which have become commoditised. This visualisation has allowed the company to identify gaps in the market and areas ripe for innovation."
