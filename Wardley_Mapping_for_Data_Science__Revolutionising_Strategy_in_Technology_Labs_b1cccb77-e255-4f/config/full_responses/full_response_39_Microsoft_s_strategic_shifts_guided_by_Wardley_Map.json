      "text": "By applying Wardley Mapping to its cloud services, Microsoft gained crucial insights into the evolving nature of infrastructure, platform, and software-as-a-service offerings. This visualisation helped the company identify gaps in its Azure platform and prioritise development efforts to compete more effectively with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP)."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "A key revelation from the mapping process was the increasing commoditisation of basic infrastructure services. This insight led Microsoft to focus on higher-value platform services and industry-specific solutions, differentiating Azure from its competitors. The company's subsequent emphasis on hybrid cloud solutions and edge computing can be directly traced to the strategic foresight provided by Wardley Mapping."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "This realisation led to strategic decisions such as acquiring GitHub, integrating Linux into Windows, and contributing to numerous open source projects. These moves positioned Microsoft as a leader in the open source community, a stark contrast to its previous stance. The mapping process helped Microsoft understand that proprietary software was moving towards commoditisation, while value was shifting towards services and ecosystems built around open platforms."
