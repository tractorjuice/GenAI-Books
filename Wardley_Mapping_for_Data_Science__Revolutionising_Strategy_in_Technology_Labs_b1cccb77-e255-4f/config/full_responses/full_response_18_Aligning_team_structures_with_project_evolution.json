This alignment ensures that organisations can adapt to the changing demands of data science projects as they progress through various stages of maturity. Wardley Mapping provides a powerful framework for visualising and strategically planning this alignment, enabling leaders to optimise resource allocation and team composition for maximum efficiency and innovation."
