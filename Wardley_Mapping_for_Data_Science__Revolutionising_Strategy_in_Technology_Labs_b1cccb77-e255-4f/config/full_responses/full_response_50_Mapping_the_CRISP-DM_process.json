      "text": "The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) has long been a cornerstone methodology in data science projects. However, as the field evolves and the strategic importance of data science initiatives grows, particularly within government and public sector contexts, there is a pressing need to enhance CRISP-DM with more sophisticated strategic tools. Wardley Mapping, with its focus on situational awareness and evolutionary thinking, presents a compelling opportunity to augment CRISP-DM and drive more effective, future-proof data science strategies."

      "text": "Mapping the CRISP-DM process using Wardley Mapping techniques can provide data science teams and technology laboratories with a more nuanced understanding of their project landscape, enabling better decision-making and resource allocation. Let's explore how Wardley Mapping can be applied to each phase of CRISP-DM, enhancing its effectiveness and strategic value."

      "text": "1. Business Understanding: In this initial phase, Wardley Mapping can significantly enhance the process of aligning data science initiatives with organisational goals. By creating a Wardley Map of the business domain, data scientists can visualise the entire value chain, from user needs to the underlying components that support them. This approach helps identify potential areas where data science can add the most value, and highlights dependencies that might not be immediately apparent in traditional CRISP-DM approaches."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "For instance, in a recent project with a UK government agency, we used Wardley Mapping to visualise the entire citizen service delivery chain. This exercise revealed several unexpected opportunities for data-driven optimisation that weren't captured in the initial project brief, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive and impactful data science initiative."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "2. Data Understanding: Wardley Mapping can enhance this phase by positioning different data sources along the evolution axis, from genesis (novel, cutting-edge data) to commodity (widely available, standardised data). This visualisation helps teams understand the relative maturity and strategic value of different data assets, informing decisions about which data sources to prioritise or where to invest in data acquisition or generation."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "3. Data Preparation: By mapping the data preparation pipeline, teams can identify bottlenecks, redundancies, and opportunities for automation or outsourcing. The evolution axis is particularly useful here, as it can highlight where custom data preparation steps might be replaced by more evolved, commoditised solutions, potentially freeing up resources for higher-value activities."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "4. Modelling: Wardley Mapping can provide valuable context for model selection and development. By mapping different modelling approaches and algorithms along the evolution axis, data scientists can make more informed decisions about which techniques to employ based on their maturity and strategic fit. This is particularly crucial in government and public sector projects, where the explainability and robustness of models are often as important as their performance."

      "text": "In my experience advising government data science teams, using Wardley Mapping to visualise the modelling landscape has often led to more balanced decisions, considering not just model accuracy but also long-term sustainability and alignment with organisational capabilities."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "5. Evaluation: Wardley Mapping can enhance the evaluation phase by providing a broader strategic context for assessing model performance and impact. By mapping evaluation metrics and business outcomes, teams can ensure that their models are not just technically sound but also aligned with the organisation's strategic goals and evolving needs."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "6. Deployment: In the deployment phase, Wardley Mapping can be invaluable for planning and executing the integration of data science solutions into existing systems and processes. By mapping the deployment landscape, including infrastructure, user interfaces, and operational processes, teams can anticipate challenges and plan for future evolution of their solutions."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Integrating Wardley Mapping into the CRISP-DM process doesn't require a complete overhaul of existing practices. Instead, it can be introduced gradually, starting with high-level maps in the Business Understanding phase and progressively incorporating more detailed mapping exercises in subsequent phases. This incremental approach allows teams to realise the benefits of Wardley Mapping while maintaining the familiar structure of CRISP-DM."

        "Start each CRISP-DM phase with a mapping exercise to set the strategic context",
        "Use Wardley Maps to facilitate communication between data scientists, domain experts, and stakeholders",

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "As the field of data science continues to evolve, particularly within the context of government and public sector applications, the combination of CRISP-DM's structured approach and Wardley Mapping's strategic insights offers a powerful framework for navigating complexity and driving innovation. By adopting this enhanced methodology, technology laboratories can position themselves at the forefront of data-driven public service delivery, ensuring that their initiatives not only solve immediate problems but also contribute to long-term strategic goals."
