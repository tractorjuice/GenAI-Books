This exercise revealed an over-reliance on custom-built solutions in areas where product-stage alternatives could offer greater efficiency. As a result, the laboratory initiated a strategic shift towards adopting more standardised tools, freeing up resources for innovation in truly novel areas."

Some innovations may leap from genesis to product stage rapidly, while others may stagnate or regress. Regular mapping exercises are therefore crucial to maintain an up-to-date understanding of the landscape."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Moreover, the position of a technology or methodology on the evolution axis can vary depending on the specific context or industry. What may be considered a custom-built solution in one sector might already be a commodity in another. This underscores the importance of conducting Wardley Mapping exercises within the specific context of your organisation and sector."

By visualising the current state and potential future trajectories of various components, organisations can make more informed decisions about where to invest their resources, how to position themselves in the market, and how to prepare for future developments in the field."
