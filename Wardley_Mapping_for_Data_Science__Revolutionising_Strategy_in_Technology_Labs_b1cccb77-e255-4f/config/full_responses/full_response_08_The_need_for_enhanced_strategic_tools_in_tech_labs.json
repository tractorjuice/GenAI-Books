By implementing Wardley Mapping, GDS was able to visualise its entire technology stack and identify areas where they were over-investing in custom solutions for commoditised functions. This led to a significant reallocation of resources towards more innovative projects, ultimately enhancing the organisation's ability to deliver value to citizens."
