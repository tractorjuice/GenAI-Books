In a Wardley Map, data sources often appear towards the left side of the evolution axis, as they are typically more commoditised.

By visualising these components and their relationships, organisations can make more informed decisions about resource allocation, technology investments, and strategic partnerships. As data science continues to evolve rapidly, this approach offers a dynamic and adaptable tool for navigating the complex landscape of data-driven decision-making in the public sector."
