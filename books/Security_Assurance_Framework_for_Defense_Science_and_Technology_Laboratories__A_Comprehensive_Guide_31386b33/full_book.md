- Escort requirements and responsibilities
- Access level restrictions and zone demarcation
- Visitor record maintenance and audit trails
- Photography and electronic device policies
- Confidentiality agreements and NDAs
- Emergency procedures for visitors

Pre-visit procedures form the foundation of effective visitor management. All visits must be pre-approved through a standardised process that includes background checks appropriate to the level of access required. This process typically begins several weeks before the intended visit, allowing sufficient time for security clearance verification and risk assessment.

- Submission of visitor details minimum 14 days prior to visit
- Security clearance verification through appropriate channels
- Host responsibility assignment and briefing
- Risk assessment based on visit purpose and access requirements
- Special considerations for foreign nationals
